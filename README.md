# ruby_template
Basic MadLib Program in Ruby with RSpec testing.

The [animal] jumped over the [planetary body]
Should ask for a animal
Should ask for a planetary body
Should be able to replace the two items in [] with whatever is given by the "user"

Have a template => Make a template class
Know what words in the template are replacable 
    => Maybe have a function that gives me a list of replacable words
    => This will return an array of strings
    => If the template is "The [animal] jumped over the [planetary body]"
    => The result of this function should be ["animal", "planetary body"]
Replace those words => Maybe have a function where I give it a list of replacements and it gives me the final filled in template
